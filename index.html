                I am from Bozeman, Montana. Bozeman is known for its wildlife 
                and scenery. It is nearby Yellowstone and Glacier National 
                Parks. It is also close to <em>epic</em> skiing and snowboarding
                at resorts like Big Sky and Bridger Bowl.

            <p>
                Some of the wildlife native to this area include moose, bighorn 
                sheep, and elk. There is plenty to do in Montana. We don't have
                impresive malls or Trader Joe's, but there is an endless amount
                to do outside.
                Tourists come from far and wide to hunt, fish,
                hike and camp.
                If you go camping, a common pastime in Montana, 
                you should bring (and be prepared to use) bearspray because you 
                will be in bear country. Don't leave your food, including 
                toothpaste, close to where you sleep at night!

                I attended a rural (out in the country) K-8th grade school in 
                Montana. I enjoyed all of my classes, but especially art and 
                math. 
                I went to my local high school after that, but only for two
                years.

            <p>
                I decided to go to boarding school in Massachusetts
                . I was hoping to
                take more challenging math classes, to refine my writing, and 
                to learn professionalism. My school, Deerfield Academy, had 
                a strict dress code and kept me on an intense schedule. 
                Right around this time, 
                I found that 
                programming is the perfect mix of math and art.
                It challenges me to
                come up with creative solutions to problems, which is why
                I started taking programming classes at my new school.
                I quickly realized that I wanted to major in computer science
                in college.

            <p>In my senior year of high school, I applied and was 
                granted admission to Caltech,
                a school that loves math and science as much as I do. It was
                an easy decision where I would attend university. I am a senior 
                now and the classes I am currently taking are:
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>art history</li>
                    <li>drawing & painting</li>
                    <li>web development</li>
                    <li>computational mathematics</li>
                    <li>machine learning</li>
                    <li>hiking</li>
                </ul>
            <p>
                It's going to be a great term and I am excited
                to be graduating in June!

                In my free time, I like to watch reality tv and listen to 
                heavy metal music.
                I also enjoy collecting posters for my room, crocheting, and 
                sewing. 
                
                I'm a Capricorn-my birthday is on Christmas Day! 

                I also have a cat named Waffle. Click

            <p>
                Since I grew up close to two ski areas, I ski raced
                on
                the weekends. My favorite events were speed events where skiers
                frequently reached speeds of over 60 miles per hour. I spent 
                quite a bit of time practicing racing through gates and also
                skiiing black diamonds, through chutes, and off cliffs.

            <figcaption>Playing soccer for Caltech</figcaption>
            <p>
                I played soccer from a young age as well. My position
                was goalkeeper because I got to direct the whole team and make
                dramatic diving saves. 
                The weather in Montana
                is frequently not very pleasant. I played in rain, mud, and even
                snow! I was excited to be a part of the Caltech women's soccer
                team and even broke two of the school records!
